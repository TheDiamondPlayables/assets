# assets
Art stuff I use for my posts.

# Purpose
 - I custom-made and use a set of graphics to make them look nicer.
 - They are stored here, mainly so I could update them and all sites using them will also have the updated graphics.
 - (I'm bad at Art and I'm learning still, so the graphics will be improved over time)

# Notes
 - This looks fuzzy - I didn't organize the filesystem before using it.
 - Was originally a test to see if updating the graphics works, and when it did, I just kinda roll with it.

# For those who've found this:
 - Keep this as a secret between us, kay? 
 - I'd have no problems when this inevitably gets revealed, this just makes it more valuable to those who've been able to discover this without anyone telling about it.
 - Also, don't use my graphics without asking me first. I know I'm bad at Art and no one would probably use this to make their posts look nice (apart from me), but still.
